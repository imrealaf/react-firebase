# React Firebase

### The fastest and most efficient way to use Firebase in a React application

- Fetch, add, and mutate Firestore data with **zero boilerplate** using provided `useDoc` and `useCollection` hooks

- These **Firestore hooks** are built on top of [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/), meaning you get all of its awesome benefits out-of-the-box

- Easily integrate **Firebase Authentication** into your app with **zero boilerplate** using the provided auth/render functions and `useAuth` hook

- Authentication state is automatically handled and maintained for you using [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/) under the hood
